Load Balancer (ALB/NLB)

Auto Scaling basics

Backup and AMI automation (like you did 😉)

💡 Hands-on:

Launch EC2 + connect via SSH.

Host a website on S3 or EC2.

Create IAM role and attach to EC2.

⚙️ 3. Ansible (Automation / Configuration Management)

At 3 years, you should be comfortable writing playbooks.

Inventory files (static/dynamic)

ansible.cfg file and settings

Playbooks and tasks

Variables, handlers, and loops

Templates (Jinja2)

Roles and directory structure

Tags and conditionals

Ad-hoc commands

Ansible Galaxy basics

💡 Hands-on:

Write playbook to install Apache/MySQL.

Create role to deploy a web app.

Use Ansible Vault for database passwords.

🐳 4. Docker (Containerization)

✅ Topics:

Docker architecture (image, container, volume, network)

Dockerfile and build process

Docker Hub and private registry

Docker Compose basics

Common commands (docker ps, docker logs, docker exec)

Image security (Trivy scanning, best practices)

Bind mounts vs Volumes

💡 Hands-on:

Build an image from Dockerfile.

Run a WordPress + MySQL app with Compose.

Scan an image with Trivy.

☸️ 5. Kubernetes (Container Orchestration)

At 3 years, basic + intermediate knowledge is expected.

✅ Topics:

Architecture (Master, Node, etcd, kubelet)

Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments

Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)

ConfigMap, Secret

Namespace

Ingress (basic)

kubectl commands

YAML manifest structure

💡 Hands-on:

Deploy Nginx pod and expose via service.

Create ConfigMap + mount it to pod.

Perform rolling update of deployment.

🔁 6. CI/CD (Automation Pipelines)

You should know Jenkins or GitHub Actions (at least one).

✅ Topics:

Jenkins installation and setup

Pipelines (Freestyle + Declarative)

Triggers (webhook, cron)

Integration with GitHub and Docker

Jenkinsfile

Jenkins agents/slaves

Artifact storage

💡 Hands-on:

Create a Jenkins pipeline to build Docker image and push to Docker Hub.

Deploy it using Ansible or Kubernetes.

📜 7. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) – Terraform

✅ Topics:

Providers, resources, variables, outputs

State file

Modules

Workspaces

Terraform Cloud basics

💡 Hands-on:

Write code to create EC2 and S3.

Use variables and output file.

Destroy and reapply infra safely.

🔒 8. Networking & Security Basics

✅ Topics:

TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP

SSH, HTTP/HTTPS, firewalls

Security Groups, NACLs (AWS)

Load balancer concepts

VPN basics

SSL/TLS certificates

💡 Hands-on:

Create VPC and test connectivity using ping or curl.

Apply firewall rules and test.

📊 9. Monitoring & Logging

✅ Topics:

CloudWatch (AWS)

Prometheus + Grafana basics

ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

Alerting setup

Log rotation

💡 Hands-on:

Setup simple CPU/memory monitoring in CloudWatch or Grafana.

💻 10. Git & Version Control

✅ Topics:

git clone, add, commit, push, pull

Branching and merging

GitHub Actions basics

Git hooks

Resolving merge conflicts

💡 Hands-on:

Create repo, push code, and trigger Jenkins pipeline.

🧰 11. Scripting (Bash / Python)

✅ Topics:

Bash loops, if-else, functions

Reading files and arguments

Simple Python scripting for automation (optional)

Using cron jobs to run scripts

💡 Hands-on:

Write Bash script to backup files.

Automate system updates.

☁️ 12. Bonus (Optional but Valuable)

Trivy / Clair → Container image scanning

Vault / Secrets Manager → Secrets handling

Helm → Kubernetes package manager

CloudFormation / ARM templates → if using AWS/Azure

DevSecOps basics → security integration in pipelines
